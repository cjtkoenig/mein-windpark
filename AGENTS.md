## Purpose
`Mein Windpark` is a Kotlin Multiplatform app (Android + iOS) that makes wind energy transparent for users in Germany.

Primary user value:
- Discover nearby wind parks.
- Search wind parks quickly and revisit recent parks.
- Understand local production context for a park and its municipality (`Gemeinde`).
- Read a practical FAQ that addresses common wind-energy questions and skepticism.

## Product Scope (Current MVP Direction)
The app has 3 top-level pages plus a detail flow:

1. `Map` page  
   - Show wind parks on a map.  
   - Allow opening a park detail.  
   - Allow favoriting a park.

2. `Search` page  
   - Search for wind parks.  
   - Keep local search history.  
   - Allow opening park detail directly.

3. `FAQ` page  
   - Explain core wind-energy topics and common critiques (example: impact on birds).

Cross-page:
- `Park Detail / Production` view for a selected wind park and related municipality data.
- Reachable from both Map and Search.

## Data Strategy
- Local-first storage for now: SQLite on device.
- Shared schema files live in:
  - `composeApp/src/commonMain/sqldelight`
- Data layer boundaries:
  - UI -> ViewModel/UseCase -> Repository -> Local DB/DAO
- UI must not call DB/SQL directly.

## Project Structure (Working Contract)
- `composeApp`: shared Kotlin/Compose code for Android + iOS.
- `iosApp`: native iOS launcher.

Inside `composeApp/src/commonMain/kotlin/app`:
- `navigation/`: routes + app nav host.
- `feature/map/`, `feature/search/`, `feature/detail/`, `feature/faq/`: feature UI/state/viewmodel.
- `core/`: shared UI primitives, models, utilities.
- `data/`: repository interfaces, local entities/DAO contracts, seed import contracts.

Platform-specific code must stay thin:
- `androidMain`: Android-only integrations.
- `iosMain`: iOS-only integrations.

## Naming + Conventions
- Use `FeatureScreen`, `FeatureViewModel`, `FeatureUiState`.
- Keep one package per feature.
- Prefer shared code in `commonMain` unless platform API forces otherwise.
- Keep architecture explicit and boring: avoid hidden side effects.

## Quality Bar for New Tasks
For each feature task:
1. Keep changes scoped to the relevant feature package.
2. Add/adjust repository contract if data behavior changes.
3. Keep navigation behavior explicit (including back behavior).
4. Add/update tests proportional to risk.
5. Keep placeholders temporary: replace with production UI/state progressively.

## Current Baseline Notes
- Navigation shell and feature placeholders exist.
- Data layer interfaces exist, but SQLite implementation is still scaffold-level.
- SQL schema files are placeholders and need real table/query definitions.

## Non-Goals (for now)
- No backend dependency required for baseline feature development.
- No cross-device sync yet.
- No analytics/telemetry requirement yet.

## Definition of Done (per vertical slice)
A feature slice is done when:
- UI flow works on Android + iOS entry points.
- State and actions are wired through ViewModel/repository boundaries.
- Required local persistence is implemented (not just interfaces).
- Behavior is documented in code-level comments/tests where non-obvious.
